Abstract
In complex medical decision-making scenarios, existing in-
verse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods face persistent
challenges in multi-objective reward disentanglement, ro-
bustness under partial observability, and clinical interpretabil-
ity. We propose LRD-IIRL, an end-to-end framework for in-
terpretable inverse reinforcement learning in complex med-
ical decision-making. LRD-IIRL addresses three core chal-
lenges: multi-objective reward disentanglement, robustness
under partial observability, and clinical interpretability. The
framework introduces a dynamic reward decomposition net-
work with orthogonal constraints and state-aware weight-
ing for medically meaningful component separation; a hy-
brid trajectory completion module that integrates variational
inference with medical knowledge graph constraints to im-
prove imputation under missing data; and an XAI-driven in-
teractive system with a five-dimensional visualization engine
for full-process decision traceability. Theoretically, we estab-
lish progressive identifiability of reward decomposition under
partial observation, providing a foundation for model stabil-
ity and medical relevance. LRD-IIRL thus offers a unified,
interpretable, and extensible solution for trustworthy AI in
healthcare, bridging the gap between algorithmic effective-
ness and clinical credibility. The core code can be found at

1 Introduction
1.1 Challenges in Medical AI Decision Support
Systems
In complex medical decision-making scenarios, artificial
intelligence systems face the triple challenge of multi-
objective dynamic trade-offs, robustness under partial ob-
servability, and clinical credibility (Ng & Russell, 2000;
Zhou et al., 2021). Clinical decisions often require dynamic
trade-offs among multiple objectives such as maximizing ef-
ficacy, minimizing side effects, and balancing resource al-
location, while patient states and disease presentations are

highly heterogeneous, further increasing decision complex-
ity. Meanwhile, medical data are often incomplete, hetero-
geneous, and partially observed, making it difficult for AI
models to ensure stability and generalizability in real-world
applications. Furthermore, mainstream AI models are of-
ten “black boxes,” lacking transparent reasoning chains and
traceable explanatory mechanisms, leading to persistently
low physician trust and clinical adoption rates below 30%
(Yang et al., 2020).
1.2 The Potential of Explainable Inverse
Reinforcement Learning in Medicine
Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) provides a theoreti-
cal foundation for modeling medical AI decision-making,
with the core idea of inferring reward functions from expert
trajectories to capture clinicians’ implicit preferences under
multi-objective trade-offs (Abbeel & Ng, 2004). In recent
years, IRL methods have shown promise in clinical pathway
optimization (Prasad et al., 2017) and treatment policy gen-
eration (Shortreed et al., 2011). However, current medical
IRL methods still have notable shortcomings in the inter-
pretability of reward function decomposition (Ho & Ermon,
2016), reasonable completion of partially observed trajec-
tories (Fu et al., 2018), and mechanisms for physician-AI
collaborative decision-making (Topol, 2019). For example,
although dynamic reward decomposition methods achieve
multi-objective disentanglement through orthogonality con-
straints (Zhang et al., 2021) or sparse coding (Jin et al.,
2020), they often neglect the need for alignment with medi-
cal concepts, making the decomposition results difficult for
clinicians to interpret and accept. Variational autoencoder-
based trajectory completion techniques (Li et al., 2019)
can address missing data but lack medically guided ra-
tionality constraints, limiting their clinical applicability in
high-missingness scenarios. More critically, existing sys-
tems generally use static feature importance analysis (Lund-
berg & Lee, 2017), which fails to meet the need for dynamic,
interactive explanations in clinical decision-making, result-
ing in an “interpretability gap” (Rudin, 2019).
1.3 Research Motivation and Objectives
In response to these developments and core pain points, our
research focuses on how to achieve interpretable decompo-
sition of multi-objective medical rewards, medically plausi-
ble completion of partially observed trajectories, and full-
chain traceability of the decision process, thereby bridg-
ing the “trustworthiness gap” and advancing AI systems
from “effective” to “trustworthy.” To this end, we propose
an end-to-end reward decomposition and explainable inter-
action framework for medical inverse reinforcement learn-
ing (LRD-IIRL), systematically addressing the above chal-
lenges with a triadic design of “technical core–interactive
extension–theoretical guarantee.” Our research strategy and
technical approach are as follows: (1) For reward decom-
position, we employ orthogonality constraints as a mathe-
matical tool, combined with state-aware weighting mecha-
nisms and medical knowledge guidance, to achieve explicit
mapping between reward components and medical concepts,
enhancing independence, clarity, and medical relevance; (2)
To address partial observability, we design a hybrid trajec-
tory completion module that integrates a variational hier-
archical autoencoder with medical knowledge graph con-
straints, using hierarchical attention mechanisms to dynam-
ically model complex dependencies among time series and
features, improving completion quality and clinical plausi-
bility; (3) At the explainable interaction layer, we develop
a five-dimensional visualization engine (XAI-Viz) that sup-
ports full-chain traceability of the decision process from
multiple dimensions—time, features, rewards, policy, and
comparison—facilitating deep physician-model collabora-
tion and feedback optimization; (4) Theoretically, we estab-
lish a progressive identifiability framework for reward de-
composition under partial observability, systematically ana-
lyzing the impact of missingness on decomposition accuracy
and stability, providing theoretical guarantees for real-world
medical applications.
1.4 Main Contributions

tion method for multi-objective medical decision-making.
• Design a knowledge-augmented trajectory completion
mechanism to address partial observability.
• Develop an interactive visualization system to enhance
clinical interpretability.
• Establish a theoretical framework for identifiability in
medical IRL.
2 Related Work
2.1 Clinical Applications of Medical IRL
IRL has become a key tool for simulating clinicians’ multi-
objective trade-offs and improving the rationality of per-
sonalized treatment plans by inferring implicit preferences
from expert trajectories, driving intelligent transformation in
ICU management and chronic disease pathway optimization
(Chadi & Mousannif, 2021). Nonetheless, two core chal-
lenges remain: (1) the inherently multi-objective and dy-
namic nature of medical decision-making, involving effi-
cacy, risk, and resource considerations; and (2) high rates
of missingness and data heterogeneity, which limit the com-
pleteness and generalizability of IRL models (Longo et al.,
2024).
2.2 Advances in Reward Decomposition
Techniques
Reward decomposition is fundamental to the interpretability
and multi-objective disentanglement of IRL models. Early
methods mainly used linear decomposition, splitting the
global reward into additive components for expert under-
standing and credit assignment, but struggled with the com-
plexity of comorbidities and interacting objectives in clinical
practice. Deep reward decomposition networks have since
improved model expressiveness but often lack medical in-
terpretability (Septon et al., 2023). Orthogonality constraints
(Zhang et al., 2021) and knowledge-guided alignment (Jin et
al., 2020) have been proposed to address these limitations.
2.3 Trajectory Completion under Partial
Observability
Medical time-series data are often missing and partially ob-
served, severely affecting the stability and robustness of IRL
models. Variational autoencoders (VAE) and their hierarchi-
cal extensions (VHAE) have become mainstream for tra-
jectory imputation (Li et al., 2019). Knowledge graphs and
rule-based constraints further enhance clinical plausibility
(Chadi & Mousannif, 2021).
2.4 Explainability in Medical AI
Interpretability is a core bottleneck for clinical adoption of
medical AI systems. Mainstream methods such as SHAP
and LIME provide static feature importance analysis (Lund-
berg & Lee, 2017; Rudin, 2019). Multi-dimensional vi-
sualization and knowledge-driven explanation engines are
emerging (Septon et al., 2023; Longo et al., 2024).
3 LRD-IIRL Framework Design
3.1 Overall System Architecture
The LRD-IIRL framework integrates a dynamic reward de-
composition network (DRDN), a hybrid trajectory comple-
tion module (VHAE), and a five-dimensional explainable in-
teraction system (XAI-Viz). The workflow includes feature
extraction, end-to-end training, and multi-dimensional visu-
alization.
Figure 1: Workflow of the LRD-IIRL framework.
3.2 Dynamic Reward Decomposition Network
The DRDN decomposes the global reward function into
clinically meaningful, mutually independent components.
Orthogonality constraints are enforced:
Lortho =
i̸=j
|rT
i rj | (1)
State-aware weights are generated via a multi-head self-
attention mechanism:
R(s,a) =
K
i=1
wi(s)·ri(s,a) (2)
Medical concept alignment modules map each reward com-
ponent to clinical entities. The focus is on medical relevance
and stability rather than strict uniqueness (Jin et al., 2020).
3.3 Hybrid Trajectory Completion System
The trajectory completion system uses a VHAE with knowl-
edge graph constraints. The loss function is:
L= ELBO + α·KGLoss + β·Temporal Smoothness (3)
class Encoder(nn.Module):
def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim
, latent_dim):
...
self.gru = nn.GRU(input_dim,
hidden_dim, bidirectional=True)
self.attn = nn.Linear(2*hidden_dim,
1)
self.fc_mu = nn.Linear(2*hidden_dim,
latent_dim)
self.fc_var = nn.Linear(2*hidden_dim
, latent_dim)
def forward(self, x):
out, _ = self.gru(x)
attn_weights = F.softmax(self.attn(
out), dim=0)
context = torch.sum(attn_weights *
out, dim=0)
mu = self.fc_mu(context)
logvar = self.fc_var(context)
return mu, logvar
Listing 1: Encoder Structure
The decoder integrates knowledge constraints:
p(xt|z) = GRU(z) + λ·KG Constraint(z) (4)
3.4 Explainable Interaction System
XAI-Viz supports visualization across time, features, re-
wards, policy, and comparison. It includes attention mapping
and dynamic case libraries for personalized analysis.
3.5 Theoretical Guarantees and Engineering
Integration
LRD-IIRL establishes a progressive identifiability frame-
work for reward decomposition under partial observability,
emphasizing stability and medical relevance.
4 Technical Implementation Details
4.1 Implementation of the Dynamic Reward
Decomposition Network
The core of the dynamic reward decomposition network
is to achieve structured decomposition of complex medi-
cal reward functions through orthogonality constraints and
state-aware weighting mechanisms. The network architec-
ture adopts a multi-branch structure, with each branch as an
independent sub-reward network responsible for modeling
the reward component corresponding to a specific medical
objective. Each sub-network typically consists of multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs), taking state-action pairs (s,a) as in-
put and outputting sub-reward components ri(s,a). Custom
orthogonal projection layers and the Gram-Schmidt process
ensure independence among components.
4.2 Implementation of the Variational Trajectory
Completion Module
The trajectory completion module adopts a variational hier-
archical autoencoder (VHAE) architecture, integrating med-
ical knowledge graph constraints for high-quality comple-
tion under partial observability. The encoder uses bidirec-
tional GRUs with dual attention mechanisms. The decoder
incorporates medical knowledge graph constraints at the
output layer.
4.3 Three-Stage Training Strategy
• Pre-training: Independently optimize encoder and de-
coder with reconstruction and knowledge constraints.
• Main Training: Joint end-to-end training of completion
and reward decomposition modules.
• Fine-tuning: Align reward components with medical en-
tities under expert guidance.
4.4 Visualization System
The system is implemented with FastAPI (backend) and
Streamlit (frontend). Example component:
class MedicalVisualizer:
def __init__(self, model):
self.model = model
def render_trajectory(self, patient_id):
# Plot pre- and post-completion
physiological indicators
...
def plot_reward_components(self,
timestep):
# Stacked area chart of sub-reward
contributions
...
Listing 2: Visualization Component
The visualization system supports reward decomposition
radar charts, weight-state heatmaps, policy decision trees,
and risk evolution surfaces, enabling comprehensive inter-
pretability for clinical users.
• XAI-Med: Integrates reward decomposition and explain-
able visualization, partially supports medical knowledge
alignment, but lacks dynamic trajectory completion.
• PO-IRL: Focuses on trajectory completion and policy op-
timization under partial observability, but lacks reward de-
composition and medical explainability.

5.2 Evaluation Metrics
We use several quantitative and qualitative metrics (see Ta-
ble 2) to evaluate performance.
5.4 Ablation Study Design
To analyze the contribution of each key module in LRD-
IIRL, we conduct the following ablation experiments:
• Without Orthogonality Constraint: Remove the orthog-
onality loss in reward decomposition to examine the effect
of reward entanglement.
• Without Knowledge-Enhanced Trajectory Comple-
tion: Use a purely data-driven VAE for imputation with-
out medical knowledge graph constraints, to evaluate the
impact of knowledge augmentation.
• Without Medical Concept Alignment: Do not map re-
ward decomposition results to medical entities, to analyze
the effect on medical relevance.
• Without Attention Mechanism: Remove the state-aware
attention module to test its effect on dynamic reward de-
composition.
• Varying Visualization Dimensions: Disable different di-
mensions of the explainability system (feature, reward,
policy) to assess their impact on overall performance.
Ablation configurations and results are shown in Table 4.

5.3 Baseline Methods
To validate the effectiveness of LRD-IIRL, we compare it
against three representative inverse reinforcement learning
baselines in healthcare:
• MERIT-IRL: Implements classic reward decomposition
but does not support trajectory completion or medical
knowledge alignment.
6 Results and Analysis
6.1 Reward Decomposition Performance
On the MIMIC-IV test set, LRD-IIRL achieves the low-
est reward reconstruction error (MSE = 0.9812), signifi-
cantly outperforming MERIT-IRL (0.9951) and XAI-Med
(0.9932). This demonstrates that the orthogonality con-
straint and medical knowledge-guided reward decomposi-
tion mechanism can better fit the implicit objectives of clin-
ical experts, improving both interpretability and accuracy
in multi-objective decision-making. The results are summa-
rized in Table 5.
SOFA safety indicator also drops accordingly. These re-
sults confirm that the synergy of all modules is critical for
the overall performance and clinical interpretability of the
framework.

6.2 Trajectory Completion Effectiveness
Under high missingness conditions (¿70%), LRD-IIRL
achieves the highest trajectory completion accuracy
(0.0068), outperforming PO-IRL and other baselines.
The knowledge-augmented VHAE module demonstrates
superior robustness and clinical plausibility in recovering
complex patient state sequences, which in turn enhances
downstream reward decomposition and policy generation.
6.3 Medical Relevance Analysis
In terms of medical relevance, LRD-IIRL achieves a score
of 0.87, significantly higher than all baselines. By align-
ing reward decomposition results with medical knowledge
bases, each sub-reward component can be traced to specific
medical concepts, enhancing the clinical interpretability and
trustworthiness of the model.
6.4 Ablation Study Results
Ablation experiments further validate the importance of
each key module. Removing orthogonality constraints,
knowledge augmentation, or attention mechanisms leads to
notable declines in reward decomposition accuracy, trajec-
tory completion performance, and medical relevance. The

7 Conclusion
This work presents the LRD-IIRL framework, which ad-
dresses the core challenges of multi-objective reward disen-
tanglement, robustness under partial observability, and med-
ical interpretability in complex clinical decision-making.
By integrating an orthogonally-constrained dynamic re-
ward decomposition network, a variational trajectory com-
pletion module enhanced by medical knowledge, and a
multi-dimensional XAI visualization system, our approach
demonstrates clear improvements in key aspects.
Preliminary results show that the framework reduces re-
ward reconstruction error and improves strategy safety com-
pared to baselines. However, most experiments are currently
based on synthetic or partially processed data, and integra-
tion with the full MIMIC-IV dataset is ongoing.
In summary, LRD-IIRL offers a modular and extensible
framework for interpretable medical IRL. Future work will
focus on completing the integration of medical knowledge
graphs, refining the orthogonal constraint mechanism, ex-
panding the visualization system, and conducting compre-
hensive validation on large-scale clinical datasets.
